# poolFreqDiff
Scripts for the analysis of allele frequency differences in genomic data from stratified populations

These scripts should be useful in the analysis of e.g. pool-seq data from experimental evolution lines.
All scripts have been tested for python 2.7 in Ubuntu 14.

The directory includes the following scripts:

1) poolFreqDiffTest_QBGLM.py

This script takes a PoPoolation/PoPoolation2-style ".sync" file and outputs an R script that can be run as a batch job.

For a help message and some details type
$ poolFreqDiffTest_QBGLM.py -h
